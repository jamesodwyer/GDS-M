# Colour

### 1. Overview

- **What it is:** Our colours convey our brand personality, values and help our fans navigate our digital interface. The right combination of colours can influence how they feel, think, and interact with our site. Using colour at the right time and place is key to this experience.

- **When to use:**
  - Creating visual hierarchy and guiding user attention
  - Conveying brand personality and values
  - Indicating interactive elements and states
  - Communicating feedback (success, error, warning)
  - Establishing relationships between surfaces and content
  - Supporting navigation and wayfinding

- **When not to use:**
  - Making tints of any of the colours
  - Using the colours to create gradients
  - Introducing any new colours or styles
  - Using colours without considering accessibility contrast requirements
  - Using dark mode colours in light mode contexts (and vice versa)

- **Accessibility note:** Accessibility is crucial to our digital experience. Using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which explain how to make web content more accessible to all users, the use of our digital colours aim to be 'AA' compliant on contrast at all times. Always pair colour with other cues like text, icons, or borders. Colour alone is not enough for users who rely on high-contrast or assistive technologies.

### 2. Colour System

Our colour system is organised into primary, secondary, tertiary, dark mode, and structural colour categories. Each colour serves specific purposes within the design system and maintains consistent usage across all Ticketmaster products.

### 3. Usage Guidelines

- **✅ Do:**
  - Use Neptune (primary) sparingly to maintain its impact — it's our brand colour and should be used for main CTA buttons and brand assets
  - Use secondary colours (Cosmos, Granite, Spotlight) for text, from headline titles to body copy and within iconography
  - Use tertiary colours appropriately: Earth for transactional buttons, Ganymede for filtering, Mars for errors
  - Use dark mode colours only on dark backgrounds to maintain AA contrast compliance
  - Use overlays (e.g., Cosmos 70% alpha) for modal backgrounds and image overlays
  - Use structural colours for UI components, borders, fills, backgrounds and structure
  - Always use system colours — never custom colours — to ensure visual consistency across light and dark themes
  - Follow the colour hierarchy to help users process content
  - Refer to the accessibility colour sheet for approved colour combinations
  - Use colour in combination with other cues (text, icons, borders) for accessibility

- **❌ Don't:**
  - Make tints of any of the colours
  - Use the colours to create gradients
  - Introduce any new colours or styles
  - Use dark mode colours in light mode contexts
  - Use colour alone to indicate interactivity or state
  - Use colours without checking WCAG AA contrast compliance
  - Mix colour categories without clear purpose

### 4. Colour Palette

#### Overlays

**Cosmos 70** (`#121212` - 70% Alpha)
- **Usage:** Modal Backgrounds & Image Overlays

**Note:** Overlays help provide focus to a component or add contrast over a busy background. They should be used as colour values themselves.

### 5. Colour Principles

#### Accessible
Our goal is to make our digital experience accessible to all users. With strong enough contrast, following AA compliance.

#### Unique
Our colours are distinctive to us. We use them to bring our digital experience to life. How we use them across our designs is part of our unique personality and identity.

#### Consistent
To be consistent, we need clarity on colour at all times. Every detail has to be closely examined when it comes to colour decisions.

### 6. Colour Hierarchy

We use colour hierarchy to help our fans process content within our digital designs. So whether we want a fan to notice the header first or the actions within the page depends on what colour hierarchy we attach to each viewable piece of content.

Having a good colour hierarchy in place makes for an overall better experience and allows us to help guide our users through sometimes essential elements of content. Not following it can lead to users feeling confused and frustrated. To help avoid this, refer to the design examples and the colour hierarchy table here.

**Hierarchy levels:**
- **1%** – Primary actions (Neptune)
- **9%** – Secondary actions and accents
- **15%** – Tertiary elements
- **20%** – Secondary text and backgrounds
- **40%** – Primary text and structural elements

### 7. Responsive Behaviour

Colour values remain consistent across breakpoints. However, colour contrast and visibility should be verified at all breakpoints to ensure accessibility compliance. Dark mode colours automatically adapt to maintain proper contrast ratios.

### 8. Accessibility (A11y)

- **WCAG Compliance:** All colour pairings must meet WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA contrast requirements:
  - **Small text** (smaller than 18pt or 14pt bold): minimum ratio = 4.5:1
  - **Large text** (equal to or larger than 18pt or 14pt bold): minimum ratio = 3:1
  - **Graphic elements** (UI components or meaningful graphics): minimum ratio = 3:1
  - **Decorative graphics** (graphics that do not provide any information): no contrast requirement

- **Accessible Pairings:** Refer to the accessibility colour sheet that lists out all the colour combinations available and what needs to be taken into consideration to comply with our AA standard goal.

- **Key Requirements:**
  - Always pair colour with other cues like text, icons, or borders
  - Never rely solely on colour to indicate interactivity or state
  - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colours
  - Verify colour combinations meet WCAG AA standards before implementation
  - Use dark mode colours only on dark backgrounds
  - If you have any doubt regarding the use of the colour, whether it be in typography, backgrounds or new components, please speak to the Global Design System team

### 9. Colour Themes (Light & Dark Mode)

As we enhance our digital experiences, dark and light modes will be an additional tool to add excitement or purpose to a page design. As such, some colour values will need to be adjusted per context to maintain AA contrast compliance.

**Light Mode:**
- Primary background: Spotlight (`#FFFFFF`)
- Primary text: Cosmos (`#121212`)
- Primary actions: Neptune (`#024DDF`)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary background: Cosmos (`#121212`)
- Primary text: Spotlight (`#FFFFFF`)
- Primary actions: Neptune Bright (`#3074FE`)

**Note:** Dark mode colours are inverse tones that allow that colour to be used on a dark background and maintain AA level colour contrast. They should not be used in other placement or as additional colours.
