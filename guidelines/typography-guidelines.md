# Typography Guidelines

### 1. Overview

- **What it is:** We use one universal typeface across all Ticketmaster assets. We use various font weights and styles to bring it to life. Using the predefined guidance allows us to create rhythm and hierarchy whilst balancing a strong visual presence.

- **When to use:**
  - Creating layouts for Ticketmaster products
  - Establishing visual hierarchy and content structure
  - Ensuring consistent typography across all screen sizes
  - Applying text styles to headlines, titles, body copy, and links

- **When not to use:**
  - Using custom fonts or typefaces outside of the Averta family
  - Modifying typography styles beyond the defined system
  - Mixing typography weights within the Title Accent style
  - Using tertiary colours as font colours

- **Accessibility note:** Always check the color text contrast when creating design layouts. Only use color combinations that pass AA accessibility standards. Minimum readable text sizes should be maintained, and line height and spacing guidance should be followed to ensure readability.

### 2. Typography System

Our typography system is built around the Averta typeface with three font weights (Regular, Semi-Bold, and Bold) and a comprehensive scale of styles for both desktop and mobile contexts. The system maintains consistent hierarchy and readability across all Ticketmaster products.

### 3. Core Palette

**Typeface:**
Our Ticketmaster typeface is Averta. We use Averta in three different font weights: Bold, Semi-Bold, and Regular. We also use a mix of uppercase and title cases across components and designs. We must restrict it to a few words when using uppercase within titles and headlines.

**Colour:**
We primarily use the colors 'Cosmos', 'Spotlight' and 'Slate' across nearly all headline titles and body copy needs. We also use the primary 'Neptune', which is mainly reserved for CTAs and links. We avoid using Tertiary colours as font colours.

**Style:**
We use the Averta typeface in a variety of ways. For headlines and titles, we use mostly Uppercase. For Secondary headlines, it's a mix of Title Case and for body copy, it's sentence case. We also have a unique Ticketmaster Styling that we use for headers.

### 6. Title Accent Component

Within our typography guidance, we have a standalone style applied to the header titles on key landing pages. It's a style that we want to make Ticketmaster uniquely different. We don't use it all the time, but when it is on show, it's vital to apply it correctly.

**Desktop Title Accent Styles:**

| Style | Accent Size | Font Size | Gap | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----|-------|
| Mauna | 8px × 60px | 54px Bold | 16px | Bespoke page titles |
| Everest | 8px × 60px | 44px Bold | 16px | Page titles |
| Kilimanjaro | 6px × 40px | 32px Bold | 12px | Panels, Modals, Sub Pages |
| Vinson | 4px × 32px | 24px Bold | 8px | Section headers |
| Blanc | 4px × 32px | 20px Bold | 8px | Topic headers |

**Mobile Title Accent Styles:**

| Style | Accent Size | Font Size | Gap | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----|-------|
| Mauna | 8px × 48px | 44px Bold | 16px | Bespoke page titles |
| Everest | 6px × 44px | 32px Bold | 12px | Page titles |
| Kilimanjaro | 4px × 32px | 24px Bold | 8px | Panels, Modals, Sub Pages |
| Vinson | 4px × 32px | 22px Bold | 8px | Section headers |
| Blanc | 4px × 24px | 18px Bold | 8px | Topic headers |

**Spacing around Title Accent:**
- Kilimanjaro (32px): 24px spacing below before body text
- Vinson (24px): 20px spacing below before body text
- Blanc (20px): 16px spacing below before body text

**Title Accent Rules:**
- The accent shape should always be positioned above the text
- The accent should always be black (#121212) - never change the colour
- The accent thickness should never be modified
- Never add other shapes above the text
- Don't indent the text - it should align with the accent
- The title text should always be uppercase
- The blue bar (accent) shouldn't go across two lines
- The blue strip always goes on the bottom line
- Never mix the typography weights within the style

### 7. Usage Guidelines

- **✅ Do:**
  - Use typography styles throughout components and layouts
  - Match typography choices to content hierarchy and layout scale
  - Stick to the predefined scale — if a new size is needed, discuss it with the system team
  - Use uppercase for headlines and titles (restrict to a few words)
  - Use title case for secondary headlines
  - Use sentence case for body copy
  - Apply typography using system styles — never fixed values — to ensure consistency, responsiveness, and adaptability across themes or brands
  - Always check color text contrast to ensure AA accessibility compliance
  - Use the Title Accent style correctly when applying it to header titles
  - Keep line length between 50-75 characters on desktop (or no more than 600px width)
  - Maintain consistent text alignment
  - Use appropriate line height and letter spacing as defined in the typography styles

- **❌ Don't:**
  - Use custom fonts or typefaces outside of Averta
  - Modify typography styles beyond the defined system
  - Use tertiary colours as font colours
  - Mix typography weights within the Title Accent style
  - Change the colour or thickness of the Title Accent shape
  - Place the Title Accent shape below the text
  - Indent text when using Title Accent
  - Use non-uppercase text in Title Accent styles
  - Exceed 75 characters per line on desktop
  - Close up or open text line height beyond defined values
  - Mix different alignment styles together
  - Use color combinations that do not pass AA accessibility standards

### 8. Responsive Behaviour

| Breakpoint | Behaviour / rule | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Desktop | Larger font sizes for headlines and titles | Mauna: 54px, Everest: 44px |
| Mobile | Smaller font sizes for compact layouts | Mauna: 44px, Everest: 32px |

**Typography Scale:**
- Desktop headline sizes: 54px, 44px, 32px, 28px, 24px, 20px
- Mobile headline sizes: 44px, 32px, 24px, 22px, 18px
- Body copy sizes: 18px, 16px, 14px, 12px (consistent across desktop and mobile with adjusted line heights)

**Line Length Guidelines:**
- Desktop: 50-75 characters per line (approximately 600px width or 6 columns on a 12-column grid)
- Mobile: Text can span from margin to margin

### 9. Line Length, Line Height, and Letter Spacing

**Line Length:**
Line length is essential to user experience. It is the distance of a text from left to right. Should the size of any given piece of text be too narrow or too wide, the text will force the reader's eye to travel uncomfortable distances, making it harder to continue reading. On average, the line length should be at most 50 to 75 characters on a desktop. Or no more than 600 pixels in width or six columns on a 12-column grid. On mobile, the text can span from margins to margins.

**Line Height:**
- Don't close up or open the text line height beyond the defined values
- Each typography style has a specific line height that should be maintained
- Line height values are defined in the typography styles tables above

**Letter Spacing (Tracking):**
- Tracking values are defined per typography style
- Most styles use 2% tracking
- Larger headline styles (Mauna, Everest, Kilimanjaro) use 5% tracking for better readability
- Don't modify tracking values from the defined system

**Alignment:**
- Always keep the alignment of text consistent
- Do not pair different alignment styles together
- Left alignment is standard for body copy and most content
- Center alignment should be used sparingly and consistently

### 10. Accessibility (A11y)

- Always check the color text contrast when creating design layouts
- Only use color combinations that pass AA accessibility standards
- Minimum readable text size requirements (WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA):
  - Body copy should be at least 16px (14px for small body copy is acceptable with proper contrast)
  - Headlines can be smaller but must maintain proper contrast ratios
- Line height and spacing guidance:
  - Maintain line heights as defined in typography styles to ensure readability
  - Ensure adequate spacing between lines for comfortable reading
- Color contrast requirements:
  - Text on background must meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
  - Use contrast checker tools to verify combinations
- Typography styles specifically used for accessibility:
  - Ensure all text uses system styles that support accessibility
  - Maintain consistent font sizes and weights for screen reader compatibility
